filamentLibrary.costGBPPerKG=Cost (GBP per kg)
filamentLibrary.remainingOnReelM=Remaining On Reel (m)
filamentLibraryHelp.name=This field can be used to name the material profile - this will be displayed on the Status page when the reel is installed in the dock.
filamentLibraryHelp.colour=Pick the material colour here, or choose custom to define your own colour.
filamentLibraryHelp.costGBPPerKG=The cost of the filament (GBP per kg).
filamentLibraryHelp.remainingFilamentM=The amount of filament remaining on the reel.
filamentLibraryHelp.ambientTemp=This value sets the temperature of the enclosed build area. By maintaining the temperature of the environment, it is possible to keep the printed object warm, reducing its tendency to shrink and warp. The best results will be obtained by maintaining the temperature of the object until the end of the print when the whole object can be cooled simultaneously. Warp is introduced when the part is cooling unevenly, with areas that are shrinking exerting forces on areas that are still warm and soft.
filamentLibraryHelp.material=The type of the material.
filamentLibraryHelp.diameter=Enter the diameter of your filament in mm - it is recommended to use digital calipers / micrometer to obtain an accurate value for this field.
filamentLibraryHelp.multiplier=This value is used to compensate for the 'squishyness' of your material. As filament passes through the extruder, it can be compressed by the feed wheels causing to change shape slightly. This can affect the amount of material that is fed to the head - the harder the material, the closer this value should be to 1.
filamentLibraryHelp.feedRateMultiplier=This multiplier allows you to finely tune the extrusion rate of the material - it can be adjusted during a print to obtain the optimum extrudate profile. Increasing the value above 1 will cause more material to be extruded and vice versa - 2 would be equivalent to 200% material flow. It varies the amount of plastic proportionally and should be changed in very small steps (e.g. +/- 0.05) as the effects are very visible.
filamentLibraryHelp.firstlayerBedTemp=This value sets the temperature of the print bed surface when printing the very first layer of the object. This value is often set higher to ensure good adhesion when starting a print, however the temperature can be lower for the remainder of the print, or it may cause the object to 'sag' at its base.
filamentLibraryHelp.bedTemp=This value sets the temperature of the print bed surface during a print. A heated bed will help to reduce warping and improve adhesion of a wide range of materials. ABS requires a bed temperature of approximately 110°C for good adhesion, whereas PLA only requires 60-80°C.
filamentLibraryHelp.firstLayerNozzleTemp=This value sets the temperature of the nozzle when printing the very first layer of the object. This value is often set higher to ensure good adhesion when starting a print, however the temperature can be lower for the remainder of the print.
filamentLibraryHelp.nozzleTemp=This value sets the temperature of the nozzle used for printing the material. Different thermoplastics require different nozzle temperatures due to their differing melting points (or more accurately, glass transition temperatures). For example, most ABS requires a nozzle temperature of 240°C, whereas PLA only requires 200°C to print successfully.

PrintQueue.SendingToPrinter=Transferring data to printer
profileLibraryHelp.name=The name of the profile
profileLibraryHelp.slicerChooser=Choose the slicer software to use.
profileLibraryHelp.layerHeight=This setting defines the layer height (essentially the print resolution) of the printed object. Users can select from any value between 20-400μm, however this setting will dramatically affect print time.
profileLibraryHelp.fillDensity=This setting changes the amount of material which is used to fill the interior of the object. 100% signifies a completely solid object, and 0% is hollow.
profileLibraryHelp.fillPattern=This setting is used to change the pattern of the extrusion used to fill the interior of the part.
profileLibraryHelp.infillEveryN=This setting forces Robox® to add a solid infill layer every n layers. To disable this option, enter 0.
profileLibraryHelp.solidLayersTop=This setting specifies how many solid layers will be used to complete the top of the object. You may need to increase this setting if you are printing an object with a top surface which tends towards horizontal to avoid gaps in the outer surface.
profileLibraryHelp.solidLayersBottom=This setting specifies how many solid layers will be used to complete the bottom of the object. You may need to increase this setting if you are printing an object with a bottom surface which tends towards horizontal to avoid gaps in the outer surface.
profileLibraryHelp.numberOfPerimeters=This setting specifies how many outside walls are produced to complete the exterior surface of the part. The more perimeters, the thicker the part walls.
profileLibraryHelp.firstLayerExtrusionWidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) when printing the first layer of your model.
profileLibraryHelp.perimeterExtrusionWidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) printing perimeters i.e. the outside layers of a model.
profileLibraryHelp.infillExtrusionWidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) when printing non-solid infill i.e. the inside filling of a model between the top and bottom solid layers.
profileLibraryHelp.solidInfillExtrusionWidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) when printing solid infill i.e. the top and bottom solid layers.
profileLibraryHelp.topSolidInfillExtrusionWidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) when printing the last top layer i.e. the top of the model’s exposed surfaces.
profileLibraryHelp.supportExtrusionWidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) when printing support material.
profileLibraryHelp.nozzleEjectionVolume=This parameter specifies the volume of material that is ejected as the needle valve closes. The needle itself has a volume, and therefore displaces its equivalent volume of plastic as the valve closes.
profileLibraryHelp.nozzleRetractionVolume=This parameter specifies the volume of material that is retracted to stop extruding the material.
profileLibraryHelp.nozzlePartialOpen=This value can be used to specify a smaller needle movement as a ratio i.e. a value of 0.5 will cause the needle valve to only open halfway.
profileLibraryHelp.supportOverhangThreshold=This angle specifies the angular size of an overhang over which support material is generated. Setting this value to '0' tells AutoMaker to determine this value automatically.
profileLibraryHelp.supportPattern=This option allows you to set the pattern used to generate the support material - with some options requiring less material, giving faster print times.
profileLibraryHelp.supportPatternSpacing=This specifies the spacing in millimetres between support extrusions i.e. the density of the support material.
profileLibraryHelp.supportPatternAngle=This option allows the direction of the support lines to be rotated in the XY plane.
profileLibraryHelp.firstLayerSpeed=This parameter changes the speed the head moves when printing the first layer in mm/s.
profileLibraryHelp.perimeterSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which perimeters (the walls of the object) are printed in millimetres per second.
profileLibraryHelp.smallPerimeterSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which small perimeters (meant for holes, islands and fine details) are printed in millimetres per second. A slower speed than 'Perimeter Print Speed' is recommended for improved quality of small details.
profileLibraryHelp.externalPerimeterSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which external perimeters (the outside surface of the object) are printed in millimetres per second.
profileLibraryHelp.infillSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which infill (the internal filling of the object) is printed in millimetres per second. This value should be as fast as you can go without compromising the integrity of the fill structure. Faster extrusions can break and result in weak spots of the object.
profileLibraryHelp.solidInfillSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which solid infill (the bottom of the object and any other solid layers) are printed in millimetres per second.
profileLibraryHelp.TopSolidInfillSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which top solid infill (the top surface of the object) is printed in millimetres per second. This is usually slower to allow time for the extrusion to cleanly cover the previous top layers and result in a tidy top surface. The last few layers should have bridged the infill structure nicely, preparing the way for a neat finish.
profileLibraryHelp.supportMaterialSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which support material is printed in millimetres per second. This value should be as fast as you can go without compromising the integrity of the support.
profileLibraryHelp.raftBaseLinewidth=This setting changes the width of a single line of extrusion (mm) when printing the first layer of the raft.
profileLibraryHelp.raftAirGapLayer0=This setting changes the height of the gap between the top of the raft and the first layer of your model in mm.
profileLibraryHelp.interfaceLayers=This setting changes the number of solid layers that are produced on top of the raft before Robox begins printing your model.
profileLibraryHelp.bridgesSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which bridges (unsupported layers between two existing surfaces) are printed in millimetres per second. The ability to span unsupported areas depends on the material and cooling. Going too slow will result in sagging, too fast will result in broken strands. Generally bridging runs slower than perimeters.
profileLibraryHelp.interfaceSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which interface material is printed in millimetres per second.
profileLibraryHelp.gapFillSpeed=This parameter sets the speed at which small gaps are printed in millimetres per second. Filling in small gaps results in the head quickly oscillating and the resulting shaking and resonance could have a detrimental affect on the print. A smaller value here can guard against this. A setting of zero disables gap filling completely.
profileLibraryHelp.enableAutoCooling=This setting is used to enable or disable automatic cooling for 3D prints. AutoMaker™ uses one of two methods to control cooling - it can either increase the fan speed or slow down the time to print a layer. The choice of which method is used is controlled by 'Enable Fan if Layer Time <' and 'Go Slow if Layer Time <'.
profileLibraryHelp.minFanSpeed=This sets the minimum fan head speed as a percentage of full power.
profileLibraryHelp.maxFanSpeed=This sets the maximum fan head speed as a percentage of full power.
profileLibraryHelp.bridgesFanSpeed=This sets the fan speed which is used when printing bridges as a percentage of full power.
profileLibraryHelp.disableFanFirstNLayers=This disables the head fan when printing the first n layers, this can help with adhering the first layer to the bed. It is recommended to leave it off for the first 1 or 2 layers.
profileLibraryHelp.enableFanLayerTimeBelow=This will increase the fan speed to maximum if the layer time takes less than the specified value in seconds.
profileLibraryHelp.slowFanLayerTimeBelow=This will slow down the print speed if the layer time takes less than the specified value in seconds.
profileLibraryHelp.minPrintSpeed=This setting is a lower limit on how slowly a layer can be printed in millimetres per second.

readyToBeginNozzleOpeningCalibration=This test will calibrate the needle valve open point. You will need a SmartReel material loaded into the Robox, and a pair of tweezers. The test will feed material to the head and melt it. For each valve you will be asked if there is material flowing out, the test will open the nozzle in small increments and ask you to check at each stage for material flow. Once you have confirmed it is flowing the values will be saved and the test will move on.
