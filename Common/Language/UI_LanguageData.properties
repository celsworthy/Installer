calibrationPanel.cancelCalibration=Cancel
calibrationPanel.chooseCalibration=Please choose the type of calibration you require.
calibrationPanel.chooseNozzleOffsetMode=Choose an option
calibrationPanel.ensureHeadIsCleanBMessage=Ensure the nozzles are clean - Use the tweezers to remove material from the openings at the bottom so when the needle valves are opened it is obvious material is being ejected.
calibrationPanel.ensureHeadIsCleanInstruction=Press 'Yes' when the nozzles are clear of material
calibrationPanel.ensureHeadIsCleanOffsetMessage=Ensure the nozzles are clean - Use the tweezers to remove and material away from the openings at the bottom so an accurate measurement can be taken.
calibrationPanel.present=Present
calibrationPanel.headCleanCheck=Before continuing to the next step, please remove any extruded material using tweezers. Click Next to continue.
calibrationPanel.heating=AutoMaker is now heating up the printhead in preparation for calibration - please wait...
calibrationPanel.heatingCaps=HEATING...
calibrationPanel.initialisingOffset=Before starting the calibration please remove the printer bed by moving the locking handle (highlighted) to the left, removing the tip wipe blade and then lifting the sheet and sliding towards you. You will need a small sheet of plain paper for the calibration and a pair of tweezers/small pliers would also be helpful for removing waste filament.
calibrationPanel.insertPieceOfPaper=Place a piece of paper underneath the left nozzle. Then click Next, and Robox will move down to grip the sheet of paper. 
calibrationPanel.isMaterialExtrudingEitherNozzle=Is material coming out of either nozzle?
calibrationPanel.isMaterialExtrudingNozzle0=Is material coming out the left nozzle?
calibrationPanel.isMaterialExtrudingNozzle1=Is material coming out of the right nozzle?
calibrationPanel.isThePaperInPlace=Press 'Yes' when the paper is in position
calibrationPanel.justRight=Just right
calibrationPanel.measuringZOffset=Robox is now determining the difference in height between the two nozzles. Please wait.. 
calibrationPanel.moveThePaperInstruction=Use the up and down arrows to adjust the height of the head. Find the lowest position that allows the paper to slide freely beneath the nozzles without touching it.\n\nWhen you've found this point, click Next to complete the calibration.
calibrationPanel.moveThePaperMessage=The piece of paper is held in place lightly by the nozzle pressed against the aluminium bed plate.\nThis part of the test will calibrate the z offset. \nContinuously try moving the paper under the nozzle, to judge its tightness. Press the 'Too Tight' button to raise the nozzle slightly, the paper will move more easily. Keep pressing the 'Too Tight' button until the nozzle is touching the paper surface but not pinching it against the bed. When correct the nozzle will be the thickness of the paper above the bed surface without pressing into the paper. Press the 'Just right' button. If the paper is loose then press the 'Too loose' button to go back down.\n
calibrationPanel.notPresent=Not Present
calibrationPanel.nozzleBCalibrationTitle=Needle valve calibration
calibrationPanel.nozzleCalibrationFailed=Sorry, it seems nozzle opening calibration has failed.\n\nBefore contacting us, please repeat the calibration, being sure you have read and followed the instructions carefully. Ensure the nozzles are clean and material is running freely with good clean output from both nozzles - if in doubt, run the purge sequence again (in Maintenance).\n\nIf your product repeatedly fails the calibration tests, please take a look at the solutions available at http://robox.freshdesk.com - if you are still unable to resolve your issue, please raise a support ticket, and we will get in touch as soon as we can. 
calibrationPanel.nozzleOffsetCalibrationTitle=Nozzle offset calibration
calibrationPanel.peiBedRemoved=Press Start
calibrationPanel.parkingMessage=Parking filament

calibrationPanel.pressAKey=Press a key when material starts to flow
calibrationPanel.pressAKeyToContinue=Press a key to continue
calibrationPanel.primingNozzle=Priming nozzle
calibrationPanel.printingCaps=PRINTING...
calibrationPanel.readyToBeginNozzleOffsetCalibration=If you are having problems with layer adhesion or inconsistencies in the height of the first few layers, please complete this calibration sequence. \n\nAs the print head switches between nozzles, the nozzle which is not printing is lifted up and out of the way of the print. Therefore the software needs to know the difference in height between the two nozzles when they are in their printing position. This routine calibrates that lift height. 
calibrationPanel.readyToBeginNozzleOpeningCalibration=This routine is used to calibrate the point at which the needle valves in the head operate. The firmware has to know the point at which the plastic begins to flow in order to accurately control extrusion.\n\nBefore beginning the calibration sequence ensure that the bed is clear of objects, the nozzles are clean and you have a SmartReel loaded. A pair of tweezers/small pliers would also be helpful for removing waste filament. 
calibrationPanel.recalibrate=Recalibrate
calibrationPanel.reinsertPEIBed=Re-install the PEI bed
calibrationPanel.replacePEIBed=Replace the PEI bed by first sliding into the tray, ensuring the surface is beneath the clips on all sides. Slide all the way to the back, and then move the locking handle (highlighted) to the right to secure in place. Finally, re-insert the tip wipe blade and click Next to complete the calibration.
calibrationPanel.retryCalibration=Retry
calibrationPanel.saveSettings=Save settings

calibrationPanel.tooLoose=Too loose
calibrationPanel.tooTight=Too tight
calibrationPanel.valvesClosedNoMaterial=Now the nozzles are heated, you need to check if the nozzles are completely sealed when the valve is fully closed.\n\nDo you see any material coming from either nozzle? 
calibrationPanel.valvesClosedNoMaterialPostCalibration=AutoMaker will now verify the calibration.\n\n Is any material flowing from either nozzle?
calibrationPanel.valvesOpenMaterialExtruding=Now, nozzles open - you should see material flowing alternately from both nozzles - is this correct? 
calibrationPanel.valvesOpenMaterialExtruding1=Right nozzle open - material should now be seen flowing out
calibrationPanel.xAndYIntroduction=If you are having problems with parts of the print being misaligned, please complete this calibration sequence.\n\nThis routine is used to set the alignment of the two printing nozzles in the X and Y direction. This allows Robox to know the location of each nozzle in respect to the other.\n\nPlease ensure that the bed is clean and clear of obstructions, you have already completed the nozzle opening and nozzle height calibrations and you have a SmartReel loaded and ready to print. If PLA is available then it is recommended to use that.
calibrationPanel.xAndYPrintPattern=AutoMaker will now print a calibration pattern - please wait...
calibrationPanel.xAndYGetOffsets=Remove the print from the bed and look for the best alignment between the output from each nozzle in the X and Y axes. Enter the number and letter which corresponds to the best aligned pair for each direction in the boxes below:
calibrationPanel.xAndYPrintingCircle=Robox will now print a circular test pattern to verify the alignment procedure. 
calibrationPanel.xAndYPrintCircleCheck=The first nozzle cross should lie exactly in the centre of the second nozzle cross. If this is not well aligned, you will need to run the calibration procedure again. If you are satisfied, click Next to continue.
